Dark Visual Studio color scheme for Sublime Text
================================================

For those who used Visual Studio and switched to Sublime Text, here is something good for your eyes. This theme is based on [mihaifm's light Visual Studio theme](https://github.com/mihaifm/Visual-Studio.tmTheme).

### Installation
- Open a Git bash in your <code>Packages</code> directory.
- Clone this repository

  ```Shell
  git clone https://github.com/nikeee/Visual-Studio-Dark Visual-Studio
  ```

This is it.


This may also work with Textmate - I did not test it, because I am not using Texmate. But you may do the following:
Drop `Visual Studio Dark.tmTheme` file in: `~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Themes/`
